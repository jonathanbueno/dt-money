# Chapter II - Personal finance application

This project is part of the Rocketseat's IGNITE course.

## The following concepts were used:

- TypeScript;
- Context API;
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect);
- Custom React Hooks;
- Props;
- Promises;
- JavaScript numbers formatting;
- Styled components;
- Mocked API (Mirage.js)

You can see some wrong commits trying to deploy this application, without success. This is something I am going to start learning next days :)
